### Using Docker

To containerize and run the frontend application using Docker:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mhzrerfani/innoscripta-news-aggregator.git
cd innoscripta-news-aggregator
```

2. Create a `.env.local` file with your API keys. Optionally, you can copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env.local`:

```plaintext
NEWSAPI_KEY=your_newsapi_key
GUARDIAN_API_KEY=your_guardian_key
```

3. Build and run the Docker container:

- Using pre-built image

```bash
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env.local ghcr.io/mhzrerfani/innoscripta-news-aggregator:main
```

- Building locally

```bash
docker build -t innoscripta-news-aggregator .
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env.local innoscripta-news-aggregator
```

This will start the application in a Docker container and make it accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
